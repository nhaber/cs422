  <h1>Project timeline</h1>
  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>The goal of this project is not to see you implement experiments/get a result, necessarily (though, wonderful if you do), but rather to spend time carefully scoping an idea that can be followed up on. If anything is unclear, please ask! Projects are to be either solo or in pairs. If you would like to work in a larger group, you will need to get permission (I will ask you to delineate what each person's role is and ask that you stick to that for the remainder of the quarter).

<h2>Milestone 1: Due Jan 12: 2 min video of project pitch (make a slide or 2)</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is to start workshopping ideas with classmates and to get everyone thinking about scoping. At this point, feel free to submit as a team, but if this aspect is not yet resolved, feel free to hold off and just explain your idea -- you can do matchmaking within the following week.</p>
<p>This is a <b>very</b> short pitch and should be a light lift. Come prepared with a slide or two, and plan on a 2-minute pitch (we'll then discuss for a few minutes). What problems are you looking to address, or more generally, what problem domain are you interested in? What collection of work are you interested in building on? What methods are you looking to explore? That is, if you have identified these. And this need not be final! Just a way for us to get started.</p>
<p>I'll post these to Canvas for everyone to see, and I'll give my own comments within the next few days. Then everyone should have a look at others' pitches and can provide feedback.</p>

<h2>Milestone 2: Due Jan 26: Project pitch update</h2>
<p>You will submit a short (~half page) follow-up report: by now, you should have settled on solo/partner/group. Please tell me about the team, describe any new scoping, and address any feedback.</p>

<h2>Throughout classes Jan 26 - Mar 2: Project update presentations</h2>
<p>Throughout classes Jan 26 - Mar 2, we'll take turns doing project update presentations (you'll sign up for presentation slots). These are meant to be informal and to get ideas from people. Meet us where you are — if it's near the beginning of the class, it's fine for things to be quite preliminary. If we're near the end of class, try to give us some good details.</p>

<h2>Milestone 3: March 9: Final presentations</h2>
<p>A "conference presentation without results." Consider including Motivation, Background & Related Work, Proposed Method & Experiments, and Next Steps. You are welcome to include any experimental results and interpretations, but this is not necessary. Please make sure you have addressed and incorporated feedback as appropriate from the earlier milestone.</p>
