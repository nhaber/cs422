  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>The goal of this project is not to see you implement experiments/get a result, necessarily (though, wonderful if you do), but rather to spend time carefully scoping an idea that can be followed up on. If anything is unclear, please ask! Projects are to be either solo or in pairs. If you would like to work in a larger group, you will need to get permission (I will ask you to delineate what each person's role is and ask that you stick to that for the remainder of the quarter).

<h2>Jan 23: initial project pitch (follow-up due Jan 30)</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is to start workshopping ideas with classmates and to get everyone thinking about scoping.At this point, feel free to submit as a team, but if this aspect is not yet resolved, feel free to hold off and just explain your idea --- you can do matchmaking the following week. We will make sure that gets resolved by the next project milestone.</p>
<p>This is a <b>very</b> short pitch and should be a light lift. Come prepared with a slide or two, and plan on a 2-minute pitch (we'll then discuss for a few minutes). What problems are you looking to address, or more generally, what problem domain are you interested in? What collection of work are you interested in building on? What methods are you looking to explore? That is, if you have identified these. And this need not be final! Just a way for us to get started.</p>
<p>Please submit the slides (and additional details, if you would like -- we'll give some feedback) to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if you do not have access, feel free to email if you would still like to participate.</p>
<p>Feel free to post in #project_ideas on Slack if you're looking to form a team.</p>

<h2>Jan 30: project pitch update.</h2>
<p>One week later, on January 30, you will submit a short (~half page) follow-up report: by now, you should have settled on solo/partner/group. Please tell me about the team, describe any new scoping, and address any feedback.</p>

<h2>Feb 22: project update.</h2>
<p>Each group submits a short (10-minute) video presentation of what you have done so far (fleshed-out motivation, background and related work, and proposed method and experiments.

<h2>Feb 27: project update workshopping.</h2>
Everyone will watch project update videos before the Feb 27 class, and each person will be assigned a certain number of videos to provide feedback. On the Feb 27 class, we will discuss feedback.

<h2>Mar 13 and 15: final presentations.</h2>
<p>A "conference presentation without results." Consider including Motivation, Background & Related Work, Proposed Method & Experiments, and Next Steps. You are welcome to include any experimental results and interpretations, but this is not necessary. Please make sure you have addressed and incorporated feedback as appropriate from the earlier milestone.</p>
