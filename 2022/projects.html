    <p>The goal of this project is not to see you implement experiments/get a result, necessarily (though, wonderful if you do), but rather to spend time carefully scoping an idea that can be followed up on. If anything is unclear, please ask!

<h2>Jan 19: initial project pitch</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is to start workshopping ideas with classmates and to get everyone thinking about scoping. This project can be done solo or with one partner. At this point, feel free to submit as a team, but if this aspect is not yet resolved, feel free to hold off and just explain your idea. We will make sure that gets resolved by the next project milestone.</p>
<p>This is a <b>very</b> short pitch and should be a light lift. Come prepared with a few slides. What problems are you looking to address, or more generally, what problem domain are you interested in? What collection of work are you interested in building on? What methods are you looking to explore? That is, if you have identified these. And this need not be final! Just a way for us to get started.</p>
<p>Please submit the slides (and additional details, if you would like -- we'll give some feedback) to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if you do not have access, feel free to email if you would still like to participate.</p>
<p>Feel free to post in #project_ideas on Slack if you're looking to form a team.</p>

<h2>Feb 21: project update.</h2>
<p>Each group submits a 2-page project update, with fleshed-out motivation, background & related work, and proposed method and experiments. Following this, each student will offer "peer review" of two proposals related to their interests, and we will give feedback as well.</p>
<p>Feel free to request additional office hours. This is meant to serve as a minimal touchpoint!</p>

<h2>Mar 9: final presentations.</h2>
<p>A "conference presentation without results." Consider including Motivation, Background & Related Work,  Proposed Method & Experiments, and Next Steps. You are welcome to include any experimental results and interpretations, but this is not necessary.</p>
