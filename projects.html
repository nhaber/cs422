<h2>Project idea (due 1.29 by end of day)</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is threefold: to get you all thinking about these early, and to let us know what you are thinking about so that we can start to guide and help. As mentioned in class, this project can be done solo or with one partner. At this point, feel free to submit as a team, but if this aspect is not yet resolved, feel free to hold off and just explain your idea. We will make sure that gets resolved by the next project milestone.</p>
<p>For this, we are simply looking for a 1-paragraph statement of first ideas. What problems are you looking to address, or more generally, what problem domain are you interested in? What collection of work are you interested in building on? What methods are you looking to explore? That is, if you have identified these. And this need not be final! Just a way for us to get started.</p>
<p>Please submit to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if you do not have access, feel free to email if you would still like to participate.</p>

<h2>Project check-in (week of 2.16)</h2>
<p>In this week, we will schedule short (10 min) check-ins with an instructor, in which we will talk about where the project is.</p>
<p>Feel free to request additional office hours. This is meant to serve as a minimal touchpoint!</p>

<h2>Project draft due (week of 3.11)</h2>
<p>This deliverable can take one of two forms:</p>
<h3>Option 1: research proposal</h3>
<p>Approximately 6 pages, a "paper without results." Consider including Motivation, Background & Related Work, and Proposed Method & Experiments. The goal of this is to have you scope a feasible future project tangibly enough that you could continue working on it in the future.</p>
<h3>Option 2: working demonstration of a proposed method.</h3>
<p>Some of you may want to get started with a working implementation of a method you are curious to try. Our intention here is to curate working demonstrations related to what we have covered in class, e.g. in a Jupyter Notebook. A focus here should be on demonstration that others can run easily as well! So, if certain packages are needed, please include a setup script...feel free to use e.g. docker if this gets complex.</p>

<h2>Peer reviews (due 3.18 by end of day)</h2>
<p>Each student will be assigned two other projects to "peer review." More explicit details to follow, but this is intended to be a generative process for suggesting new ideas and related work to check out.</p>
</div>

<div class="sechighlight">
<div class="container sec">
<h2>Project expo (Finals week)</h2>
<p>Each student/group gives a short presentation on their work, incorporating the peer review feedback as appropriate. Think poster session, but online.</p>
