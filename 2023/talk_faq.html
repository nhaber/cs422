  <h1>Presentation hints & expectations</h1>
  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>Below is a collection of hints & expectations for giving presentations. If anything is unclear, please ask! It's probably unclear to others, too.

<h3>Timing</h3>
  <p>Plan on 50 minutes devoted to the presentation. This includes both speaking time and structured discussions (breakouts/full group chats with some direction). If less structured discussions come up, feel free to let them evolve, and the instructors might make the call to allow the presentation/discussion time to spill over into the rest of the class</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that time goes by <b>fast</b>. Questions and discussions, in particular, make time fly more than you might think.
<h3>Interactivity</h3>
  <p>It can be very useful to break up the presentation with some sort of structured discussion. This can either be as a full group or in breakouts (potentially followed by a full-group wrap-up). Feel free to get creative! </p>
  <p>Breakouts can be particularly useful so as to get everyone involved and to allow more ideas to come up. But this is certainly no requirement.</p>
<h3>Presentation format</h3>
  <p>How you devote talking time is really up to you. There are useful standard structures to follow: Motivation, Methods, Experiments, Discussion. These can help us stay oriented.</p>
  <p>Slides that contain screenshots of the paper's main figures can be very helpful. Often we just need to stare at these, as a group.</p>
<h3>Before your talk</h3>
  <p>Students often find it helpful to have a pdf copy or google slides link of the slides that they can follow along with during class. Please email me that right before class, and I will upload them to Canvas.</p>
  <p>If you need the instructor to help do anything in particular during the talk (e.g. start a breakout with more structure than random assignment), please give us a heads-up beforehand so that we can have this ready.
